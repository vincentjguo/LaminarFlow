# LaminarFlow
Extension to improve the [UWFlow](https://uwflow.com) website by adding back 
locations and professor information.

Requires a UWaterloo account and the [QuestAPI](https://github.com/vincentjguo/QuestAPI) backend to work.

## TODO

- [X] Add client/server side caching
- [X] Improve idle session handling (may not be required if caching is implemented)
- [ ] Increase reliability, add tests, log cleanup, and general cleanup
- [ ] Improve extension UI
- [ ] Potentially add shopping cart functionality
